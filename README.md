# Jin Choe Portfolio

## Description

Being a web developer means being part of a community. Youâ€™ll need a place not only to share your projects while you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share your work with other developers and collaborate on projects.

This portfolio uses React and other new technologies which will help set it apart from other developers. It features a single page layout that includes an about me, portfolio, as well as a contact form.
